- Hi guys! Nada and Joseph have consolidated the code into `stereo_odometry.py`. We have included some functions for executing tasks 1-5. The only bottleneck here is that we have not been able to test the code due to a lack of space to download the dataset, so we still need to double-check things.

- If you find any bugs, please fix them and update this note.

- Moses and Joseph will try to test the code tonight, so here's what's left:
  1. Create some nice plots
  2. Attempt the bonus tasks
  3. Evaluate performance
